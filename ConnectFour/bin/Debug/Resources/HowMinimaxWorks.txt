the tree of possible boards is traversed via the leaf nodes, (all the way along the bottom), then, depending on whether the player is the minimiser
or the maximiser, the computer will assume they take the best possible outcome. This value (smallest or largest based on maxi or mini) is passed to 
the parent node of these 7. This continues on this depth (one above), then to the next depth, then the next, untill the parent node is reached.
